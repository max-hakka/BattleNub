	  <h2>How to Play</h2>

      <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ships can be placed horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally.</li>
		<li>You must place all five ships on the grid.</li>
		<li>Every ship must be completely on the grid. No ship can hang off the edge of the board.</li>
		<li>Ships cannot overlap each other.</li>
		<li>Once your ships are placed and the game has begun, you are not allowed to move your ships again.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
      	<li> Take turns to shoot at a coordinate by clicking on a square in the top grid. </li>
      	<li>In the bottom grid you can see where your enemy is shooting.</li>
      </ul>
      Tip! Once you manage to hit the opponent's ship, try aiming for squares next to it in the same row or column, so you can find the rest of the ship.
